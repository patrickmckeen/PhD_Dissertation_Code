This is the code used for much of my PhD Dissertation. Some parts of it are more polishhed than others. It includes various iterations of the same code. Future development is expected on much of it, and future branches should be considered.

The McKeenADS folder contains most of the work for the estimation and disturbance chapters.

The material for the planning chapter is split across the McKeenADS folder and beavercube-rpi-master, as these are different eras of the same work.

Code for the Goals and Operations chapter can be found in another repository: https://github.com/patrickmckeen/quaternion-pointing
